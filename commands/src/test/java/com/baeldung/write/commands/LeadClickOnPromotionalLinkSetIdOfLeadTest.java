================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Randomness (CWE-330)
Issue: UUIDs if not generated securely, can introduce potential vulnerabilities which can be targeted by attackers to predict the UUID.
Solution: Ensure that UUIDs are generated using a secure method. Java provides a method UUID.randomUUID() that generates a random UUID using a cryptographically strong pseudo random number generator.

Vulnerability: Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: If unvalidated input is entered into the method, it could lead to potential vulnerabilities.
Solution: Implement proper input validation for all incoming data. Even though in this case the method accepts UUID as a parameter, consider the source of this UUID. If it's from an untrusted source, validate before usage.

================================================================================
"""
 Scenario 1: Given a valid UUID input
  Details:  
    TestName: setValidUUID
    Description: This test ensures that the idOfLead can successfully set a valid UUID input. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid UUID.
    Act: Call the setIdOfLead() method with the valid UUID as the argument. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the idOfLead has been set properly.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the idOfLead can be updated with a valid UUID. Validating this is crucial so we can confidently set UUIDs without leading to issues in the application. 

 Scenario 2: Given a null UUID input
  Details:  
    TestName: setNullUUID 
    Description: This test ensures that the idOfLead handles null input gracefully.   
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign null to a UUID variable.
    Act: Call the setIdOfLead() method with the null UUID as the argument. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the idOfLead is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that when given a null input for the UUID, the setIdOfLead() doesn't cause an exception and it sets idOfLead as null. This is crucial to ensure smooth execution in scenarios where UUID can be null in real application usage. 

 Scenario 3: UUID reset test
  Details:  
    TestName: resetUUID
    Description: This test validates that the setIdOfLead() can reset/update the previous UUID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a valid UUID to idOfLead and then assign a different UUID.
    Act: Call the setIdOfLead() method first with the initial UUID and then with the updated UUID. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to assert that the idOfLead is equal to the new updated UUID (not the initial UUID).
  Validation: 
    This test confirms that the setIdOfLead() method can successfully reset the idOfLead. This would be valuable to make sure that the UUID of a lead can be updated in scenarios where it may be necessary to change the UUID.
