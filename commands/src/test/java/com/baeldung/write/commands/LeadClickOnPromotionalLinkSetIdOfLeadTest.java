================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Inappropriate UUID assignment
Issue: The setIdOfLead() function allows for any UUID to be set. This could allow an attacker to potentially assign the idOfLead to any arbitrary value, leading to data inconsistency or unauthorized access to data.
Solution: UUID should not be assigned arbitrarily. You should always ensure that the assignment is validated and strictly controlled. You could introduce a check to see if the UUID being assigned actually exists in your database, and only allow the assignment if the check passes.

Vulnerability: Method visibility
Issue: The method setIdOfLead() visibility is public, which means it can be accessed from anywhere in the application or outside the application. This could lead to accidental or intentional misuse of the method.
Solution: Consider making the method private or protected as per the need of the application, limiting the scope of its accessibility. This ensures that the method can only be accessed from within the same class or subclasses.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test UUID assignment
  Details:  
    TestName: testIdOfLeadAssigment
    Description: This test is meant to check if the UUID assigned via setIdOfLead method is properly set as the id of Lead. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a UUID for testing.
    Act: Invoke setIdOfLead with the created UUID.
    Assert: Read the value of idOfLead and use JUnit assertions to compare it with the created UUID.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies if the method setIdOfLead accurately assigns the id. The significance of the test lies in confirming the proper functioning of data assignment within the object.

Scenario 2: Test id retention
  Details:  
    TestName: testIdRetention
    Description: This test is meant to verify if setIdOfLead retains the UUID value after multiple invocations. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different UUIDs for testing.
    Act: Invoke setIdOfLead first with the first UUID, then with the second UUID.
    Assert: Read the value of idOfLead and use JUnit assertions to compare it with the second UUID.
  Validation: 
    This test checks that the ID is replaced after a new invocation of setIdOfLead. It primarily ensures method's correct handling of multiple calls.

Scenario 3: Test null UUID
  Details:  
    TestName: testNullUUID
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the method handles null UUID appropriately without throwing an exception. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No UUID needs to be arranged for this test.
    Act: Invoke setIdOfLead method providing null as parameter.
    Assert: Read the value of idOfLead and use JUnit assertions to check if it is null.
  Validation: 
    This test validates that a null invocation does not result in exception or erratic behavior of the setIdOfLead method, ensuring method's robustness.
