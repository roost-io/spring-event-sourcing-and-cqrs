ROOST_METHOD_HASH=setIdOfLead_b4a4f46ab3
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=setIdOfLead_5031dee72d

Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the provided setIdOfLead method:

Scenario 1: Set a valid UUID as the lead ID

Details:
  TestName: setValidUuidAsLeadId
  Description: This test checks if the setIdOfLead method correctly sets a valid UUID as the idOfLead field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setIdOfLead method. Generate a valid UUID.
  Act: Invoke the setIdOfLead method with the generated UUID.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the idOfLead field is equal to the provided UUID.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setIdOfLead method correctly assigns the provided UUID to the idOfLead field.
  This test ensures that the method functions as expected when provided with a valid UUID.

Scenario 2: Set null as the lead ID

Details:
  TestName: setNullAsLeadId
  Description: This test checks if the setIdOfLead method handles setting a null value as the idOfLead field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setIdOfLead method.
  Act: Invoke the setIdOfLead method with a null value.
  Assert: Use assertNull to verify that the idOfLead field is set to null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setIdOfLead method allows setting the idOfLead field to null.
  This test ensures that the method can handle null values and does not throw any exceptions.

Scenario 3: Set the lead ID multiple times

Details:
  TestName: setLeadIdMultipleTimes
  Description: This test checks if the setIdOfLead method correctly updates the idOfLead field when called multiple times with different UUIDs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setIdOfLead method. Generate two different valid UUIDs.
  Act: Invoke the setIdOfLead method with the first UUID. Then, invoke the setIdOfLead method again with the second UUID.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the idOfLead field is equal to the second UUID.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setIdOfLead method correctly updates the idOfLead field when called multiple times with different UUIDs.
  This test ensures that the method always sets the latest provided UUID as the idOfLead.

Scenario 4: Set the lead ID after initialization

Details:
  TestName: setLeadIdAfterInitialization
  Description: This test checks if the setIdOfLead method correctly sets the idOfLead field when called after the object has been initialized with a null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setIdOfLead method. Ensure that the idOfLead field is initially null. Generate a valid UUID.
  Act: Invoke the setIdOfLead method with the generated UUID.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to verify that the idOfLead field is equal to the provided UUID.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the setIdOfLead method correctly sets the idOfLead field even when called after the object has been initialized with a null value.
  This test ensures that the method can be used to set the idOfLead field at any point during the object's lifecycle.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the setIdOfLead method, including setting a valid UUID, handling null values, updating the idOfLead field multiple times, and setting the idOfLead field after object initialization. They ensure that the method behaves as expected in different scenarios.
