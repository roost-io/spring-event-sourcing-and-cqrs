ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=setIdOfLead_5031dee72d

Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the provided setIdOfLead method:

Scenario 1: Setting a valid UUID as the lead ID

Details:
  TestName: setValidUuidAsLeadId
  Description: This test verifies that the setIdOfLead method correctly sets a valid UUID as the lead ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid UUID using UUID.randomUUID().
  Act: Invoke the setIdOfLead method with the created UUID.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the actual idOfLead value against the expected UUID.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the idOfLead field is properly set to the provided UUID.
  This test is important to validate that the method correctly assigns the given UUID to the idOfLead field.

Scenario 2: Setting a null UUID as the lead ID

Details:
  TestName: setNullUuidAsLeadId
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setIdOfLead method when a null UUID is passed as the lead ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed.
  Act: Invoke the setIdOfLead method with a null UUID.
  Assert: Use assertNull to verify that the idOfLead field remains null after the method invocation.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method handles a null UUID gracefully and does not throw an exception.
  This test is crucial to ensure that the method can handle null input without causing unexpected behavior or crashes.

Scenario 3: Setting a new UUID after a previous one

Details:
  TestName: setNewUuidAfterPreviousUuid
  Description: This test verifies that the setIdOfLead method correctly updates the idOfLead field when a new UUID is set after a previous one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two distinct valid UUIDs using UUID.randomUUID().
  Act: Invoke the setIdOfLead method with the first UUID, then invoke it again with the second UUID.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the actual idOfLead value against the expected second UUID.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the idOfLead field is properly updated to the new UUID when the method is called multiple times.
  This test is important to validate that the method correctly overwrites the previous UUID with the new one.

Scenario 4: Setting the same UUID multiple times

Details:
  TestName: setSameUuidMultipleTimes
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setIdOfLead method when the same UUID is set multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid UUID using UUID.randomUUID().
  Act: Invoke the setIdOfLead method with the created UUID multiple times.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the actual idOfLead value against the expected UUID.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that setting the same UUID multiple times does not cause any unexpected changes to the idOfLead field.
  This test is important to ensure that the method behaves consistently when the same UUID is provided repeatedly.

These test scenarios cover different aspects of the setIdOfLead method, including setting a valid UUID, handling a null UUID, updating the UUID, and setting the same UUID multiple times. They aim to validate the correct behavior of the method under various conditions.
