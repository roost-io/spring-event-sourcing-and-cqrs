================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Potential null object reference
Issue: If the 'name' variable is null, a null pointer exception could be thrown.
Solution: Ensure that objects are initialized before they are used. Null checks should be implemented before accessing methods or properties of a variable.

Vulnerability: Unchecked/Unsafe Operations
Issue: The code doesn't show any type checks for 'name'. if 'name' is not guaranteed to be a string, calling 'hashCode()' could cause a runtime error.
Solution: Type checks or type constraints can be used to ensure the variable is of the correct type before performing operations on it.

Vulnerability: Insecure Hash Function
Issue: hashCode() is not a secure hash function, if its output is used in a sensitive context, it could lead to problems including hash collisions.
Solution: Use a secure hash function if a hash value is being used in a secure context. For replacement, consider using better cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256 for that case.

"""
Scenario 1: Valid 'name' variable

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithValidNameVariable
  Description: This test scenario is designed to check the hashCode() method when the 'name' variable contains valid data (not null).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid 'name' variable string and assign it to a test instance.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode() method through the test instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned integer is as expected (a unique hashcode generated based on the 'name' variable).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode() method correctly generates a consistent unique hash based on the 'name' variable. This ensures that the mechanism responsible for differentiating between objects based on their 'name' is working as intended.

Scenario 2: Null 'name' variable

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullNameVariable
  Description: This test scenario is meant to validate the behavior of the hashCode() method when the 'name' variable is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the 'name' variable of a test instance to null.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode() method of the test instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned integer is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode() method correctly handles the 'name' variable when it is null, returning a zero value. This test ensures the robustness of the application, validating its behavior even in exceptional or error case scenarios.

Scenario 3: Empty 'name' variable

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithEmptyNameVariable
  Description: This scenario aims to verify the working of the hashCode() method wherein the 'name' variable is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the 'name' variable of a test instance to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode() method from the test instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the returned integer corresponds to the hashCode of an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion is set up to verify that the hashCode() method correctly identifies 'name' variable which is even an empty string. This test ensures that our code can properly handle edge case scenarios, preventing erroneous behavior.
