================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Null Handling (CWE-476)
Issue: Incorrect handling of null objects in Java can lead to NullPointerException which can potentially disrupt the application flow or lead to Denial-Of-Service (DoS) attacks.
Solution: Ensure that all input variables are properly checked for null values before they are used. In the provided code, the check is already implemented. Always use objects' built-in methods for comparing and checking instead of direct comparison.

Vulnerability: Insecure Hashing (CWE-328)
Issue: If the name variable (which is not seen in this code) is sensitive data, then a collision attack can recreate the hash generated. This can potentially lead to exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Do not use hash functions for storing or comparing sensitive data. If it is necessary, then use a secure hash function like SHA-256 or equivalent.

"""
Scenario 1: Validate HashCode for Given Name as Null

  Details:  
    TestName: validateHashCodeWhenNameIsNull
    Description: This test is meant to check the output of hashCode method if the name variable is null. The hashCode method should return 1 in this case.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the name variable to null. 
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is equal to 1.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the hashCode method is correctly returning a hash value of 1 when the name variable is null. This is significant in ensuring the uniqueness and correct implementation of the hash function.

Scenario 2: Validate HashCode for a Given Empty String as Name.

  Details:   
    TestName: validateHashCodeWhenNameIsEmpty
    Description: This test is to check the output of hashCode for an empty string as a name. The hashCode method should return prime number in this case.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the name to empty string.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is equal to prime number i.e. 31.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the hashCode method is correctly returning a prime number when the name variable is an empty string. The test's significance is to ensure the hash function's correct functionality when the input is not null but an empty string.

Scenario 3: Validate HashCode for a Given Non-Empty Name.

  Details:  
    TestName: validateHashCodeWhenNameNotEmpty
    Description: This is to test the hashCode method when it receives a non-empty string as a name. The test is to ensure that the hash function produces unique and consistent values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set name to a non-empty string.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare output with the expected hashCode.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the hashCode method is correctly returning the calculated hash value for a non-empty string. This is significant as it checks the correct functionality and the uniqueness of the implemented hash function for non-empty strings.

Scenario 4: Validate HashCode for Multiple Calls with Same Name

  Details:  
    TestName: validateHashCodeConsistencyForMultipleCalls
    Description: This test is designed to check the consistency of the hashCode method by invoking it multiple times with the same name. The method should always return the same hashCode for the same string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the name variable to any non-empty string.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method multiple times with the same name.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare returned hashCode values from all invocations.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method returns consistent values for multiple invocations with the same name. This validates that the hash function works as expected, demonstrating idempotency and consistency.
