ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_5a2657087a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Potential NullPointerException
Issue: The 'name' variable is being used without an explicit null check. If 'name' were null, the .hashCode() method would throw NullPointerException.
Solution: To avoid this, ensure to make a null check before referencing any methods on 'name'. For instance: result = prime * result + (name == null) ? 0 : name.hashCode();

Vulnerability: Hard-Coded Prime Number
Issue: The prime number used in the hashCode calculation is hardcoded. Any changes to this constant will require modifying the source code and recompiling.
Solution: A potential way to improve this could be by making prime a final static variable at the class level. For instance: private static final int PRIME = 31;

Vulnerability: Potential Inequality in hashCode
Issue: In the event that 'name' is null, the hashCode method would always return 31. This could lead to collisions if more fields have null values.
Solution: Possibly encapsulating the logic of the hashCode() calculation in a separate method would be better. If the use of null is expected in the system, consider utilizing Objects.hashCode(Object), which is null-safe.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Name Property Null Value
Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNullName.
    Description: This test is designed to verify the output of the hashCode method when the name property is null.
 Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the name property to null.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Confirm that the output equals 1.

Validation:
    This test verifies that the hashCode method correctly handles null values by returning 1.

Scenario 2: Test for Name Property With Non-Null Value 
Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNonNullName.
    Description: This test checks the behavior of the hashCode method when the name property contains a non-null value.
 Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a specific non-null value to the name property.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Confirm that the output equals (31 * 1 + name.hashCode()).

Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly calculates the hash for non-null name values. The expected result is based on the formula used in the method.

Scenario 3: Test for Name Property With Same Value Twice
Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWithSameNameTwice.
    Description: This test checks whether the hashCode method will return the same hash code when invoked twice with the same name value.
 Execution:
    Arrange: Set the name property to a specific value.
    Act: Call the hashCode method two times.
    Assert: Assert that the two output values are equal.

Validation:
    This test verifies the consistency of the hashCode function, which should always return the same hash code for the same input.

Scenario 4: Test for Name Property With Different Values
Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWithDifferentNameValues.
    Description: This test checks whether the hashCode method will return different hash codes for different name values.
 Execution:
    Arrange: Set the name property to two different values.
    Act: Call the hashCode method for each value of the name.
    Assert: Assert that the two output values are not equal.

Validation:
    This test verifies the uniqueness property of the hashCode function. For different inputs, it should return different hash codes.
