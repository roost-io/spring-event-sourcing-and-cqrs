"""
  Scenario 1: Simple test for hashCode method with a non-null name

  Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNonNullName.
    Description: This test checks the functionality of the hashCode method when the 'name' instance variable is not null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock instance of the class with a non-null 'name' variable.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the created object.
    Assert: The assertion compares the returned hash code with the expected output.
  Validation:
    The assertion validates that the returned hash is correct as per the hashCode method implementation. This is important to ensure that the hashCode function works correctly for non-null 'name' variables.

  Scenario 2: Simple test for hashCode method with a null name

  Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeWithNullName.
    Description: This test checks the functionality of the hashCode method when the 'name' instance variable is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock instance of the class with a null 'name' variable.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the created object.
    Assert: The assertion compares the returned hash code with the expected output.
  Validation:
    The assertion validates that the returned hash is correct as per the hashCode method implementation. This is crucial to ensure that the hashCode function works accurately when dealing with null 'name' variables.

  Scenario 3: Test for hashCode method consistency

  Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeConsistency.
    Description: This test checks if the hashCode method is consistent. It means, if called multiple times on the same object, it should always produce the same result.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock instance of the class.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method multiple times on the same object.
    Assert: The assertion checks if the multiple invocations of hashCode method on the same object always return the same hash code.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures the consistency of the hashCode method. This is significant because, by contract, the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons is modified.

  Scenario 4: Test for hashCode method with two equal objects

  Details:
    TestName: testHashCodeForEqualObjects.
    Description: This test checks if the hashCode method returns the same integer for two equal objects as per the contract of the hashCode method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two equal mock instances of the class.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
    Assert: The assertion checks if the hashCode for both objects is the same.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures that the hashCode method meets its general contract, which states that if two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result. This is important to fulfill the contract of the hashCode method.
