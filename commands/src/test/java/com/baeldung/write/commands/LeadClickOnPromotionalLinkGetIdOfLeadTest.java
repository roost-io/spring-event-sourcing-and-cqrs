ROOST_METHOD_HASH=getIdOfLead_449a1730e1
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getIdOfLead_aeb9b47e90

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Leakage and Improper Access Control
Issue: The function getIdOfLead() is public and exposes the ID of the lead. This could lead to Information Leakage if this ID is sensitive information and may bring the dangers of Broken Access Control if the IDs are predictable and not suitably protected.
Solution: You could mitigate this vulnerability by restricting access to the getIdOfLead() method or protecting the IDs in some way, possibly making them unpredictable, or adding suitable access controls.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Return Scenario Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testValidReturnOfGetIdOfLead 
    Description: This test is designed to verify whether the method is returning the correct UUID corresponding to the lead. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is needed, as this is a getter method with no input parameters.
    Act: Call the getIdOfLead() method. 
    Assert: Assert that the returned UUID is the expected one.
  Validation: 
    This test scenario tries to affirm that the getIdOfLead method is performing its intended functionality correctly. Verifying that the returned UUID matches the expected one ensures that the lead ID is retrieved as it should. Its signification lies in confirming that the method can accurately carry out the task of getting a Lead's ID.

Scenario 2: null UUID Return Scenario Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testNullUuidReturn 
    Description: This test is intended to check if the getIdOfLead() method correctly handles and returns null when the idOfLead variable is not initialized. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is needed, as this is a getter method with no input parameters.
    Act: Call the getIdOfLead() method.  
    Assert: Assert that the returned UUID is null.
  Validation: 
    This test scenario tries to find out how the getIdOfLead method behaves when idOfLead is not initiated. It tests whether the method is capable of managing such cases and returning null, thereby enhancing its robustness. The expected outcome serves as a measure of the method's ability to handle non-standard conditions safely.

Scenario 3: Persistent Value Return Test
  
  Details:
    TestName: testPersistentUuidReturn 
    Description: This test is designed to check whether the getIdOfLead() method is correctly maintaining the unique identifier value over a period and multiple calls.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is needed, as this is a getter method with no input parameters.
    Act: Call the getIdOfLead() method multiple times.
    Assert: Assert that the returned UUID remains the same across multiple invocations.
  Validation:
    This scenario validates how the getIdOfLead method handles and maintains a persistent ID through multiple calls. The expectation is to have a consistent output, ensuring the uniqueness and consistency of the Lead's ID across an application or a session. It allows validating the method's capability of maintaining the Lead's ID consistently.
