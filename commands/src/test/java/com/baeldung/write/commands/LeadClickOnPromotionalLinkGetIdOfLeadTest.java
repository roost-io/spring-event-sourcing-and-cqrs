================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If the 'idOfLead' is used as part of a GET request URL, it may lead to information exposure. Since HTTP GET requests do not encrypt query string, sensitive information in these queries can be exposed to unauthorized attackers through various ways such as server logs and browser history.
Solution: Do not include important data in your URL query string. Use HTTP POST request instead or use HTTPS which encrypts your queries.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the 'idOfLead' is sensitive in nature, its exposure through getter method could be a privacy violation. Developers may inadvertently expose this data, leading to information disclosure.
Solution: Prevent exposure of sensitive information. If necessary, apply appropriate access control measure to limit the visibility.

"""
  Scenario 1: Verify the getIdOfLead Method for Null Value
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetIdOfLeadForNullValue
    Description: This test will verify the getIdOfLead method for null value. It is meant to check if the method is capable of handling null values. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set idOfLead as null.
    Act: Invoke the getIdOfLead method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion is checking that the getIdOfLead method can handle null values and returns null when such an event occurs. This is a significant test to validate that no null pointer exceptions are thrown when there is no lead id. 

  Scenario 2: Confirm Correct Retrieval of the Lead ID 
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetIdOfLeadForValidUUID
    Description: This test will confirm that the getIdOfLead method retrieves the appropriate lead ID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a valid UUID to idOfLead.
    Act: Invoke the getIdOfLead method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value matches the assigned UUID value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to validate that getIdOfLead method accurately returns the assigned UUID identifying the lead. This test is significant as it ensures the method's fundamental functionality is working as expected.

  Scenario 3: Ensure Consistent Results from getIdOfLead Method
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetIdOfLeadForConsistency
    Description: This test will ensure that the getIdOfLead method consistently returns the same UUID for the lead on multiple invocations. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Call getIdOfLead method for first time and store the result.
    Act: Invoke the getIdOfLead method again.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the second output is equal to the first output.
  Validation: 
    The aim of this assertion is to validate that getIdOfLead function is idempotent, meaning invocations with the same context and arguments consistently produce the same output. This is a significant test to ensure predictable and reliable output from the function.
