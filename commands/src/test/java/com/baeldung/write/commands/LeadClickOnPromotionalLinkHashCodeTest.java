================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: If the 'idOfLead' contains sensitive information and the hash code is shared or exposed, it could lead to information leakage causing potential security issues.
Solution: Ensure the 'idOfLead' does not hold sensitive data. If it does, implement appropriate security measures such as data masking or encryption before usage.

Vulnerability: Unvalidated User Input CWE-20
Issue: 'idOfLead' is not validated before using in calculation of hash code, it can potentially lead to injection attacks if original input isn't properly sanitized.
Solution: Before using 'idOfLead' for calculating hashCode, validate and sanitize the input to prevent any potential security threats from malicious input.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Test When idOfLead is not null

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeNonNullId.
    Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when idOfLead is not null. We create a UUID, assign it to idOfLead and then check if the hashcode method returns the expected result.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a non-null UUID to idOfLead.
    Act: Invoke hashCode method.
    Assert: Compare the result against an expected generated hash.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that hashCode method generates an expected hash when idOfLead is not null. This is important as it ensures the uniqueness of the hash based on the idOfLead.

  Scenario 2: Test When idOfLead is null

  Details:  
    TestName: testHashCodeNullId.
    Description: This test is meant to check the hashCode method when idOfLead is null. In this case, the hashcode method should return a specific static value (1 in this case). 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign null to idOfLead.
    Act: Invoke hashCode method.
    Assert: Assert that the result is equal to 1.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the hashcode method returns 1 when idOfLead is null. This shows that the method handles null inputs gracefully without causing errors or exceptions.

  Scenario 3: Consistent Hash Values

  Details:  
    TestName: testConsistentHashValues.
    Description: This test checks whether the hash code method returns consistent values. That is, for a particular idOfLead, the hashCode must always return the same hash regardless of when it's called.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a non-null UUID to idOfLead.
    Act: Invoke hashCode method twice.
    Assert: Assert that the two results are equal.
  Validation: 
    This verifies that the hashCode method values are consistent across repeated calls. This is vital for maintaining the integrity of the hash function.

  Scenario 4: Test Two Different idOfLeads Generate Different Hashes

  Details:
    TestName: testDifferentIdGenerateDifferentHash.
    Description: This test checks the scenario if two different uuids generate different hashcodes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign two different non-null UUIDs to idOfLead in two separate instances.
    Act: Invoke hashCode method for both instances.
    Assert: Assert that the two results are not equal.
  Validation:
    This verifies that different idOfLeads produce different hashcodes, which is important for object distinction.
