ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_5a2657087a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The hashCode() method does not handle the case where idOfLead is null. If idOfLead is null, calling hashCode() on it will result in a NullPointerException. This can lead to unexpected program behavior or denial of service.
Solution: Modify the hashCode() method to properly handle the case where idOfLead is null. For example, you can return 0 or a constant value when idOfLead is null to avoid throwing a NullPointerException.

Vulnerability: CWE-597: Use of Wrong Operator in String Comparison
Issue: The hashCode() method uses the == operator to compare idOfLead with null. In Java, the == operator compares object references, not the actual content of the objects. This can lead to incorrect comparisons and unexpected behavior.
Solution: Replace the == operator with the equals() method when comparing objects for equality. For example, use Objects.equals(idOfLead, null) or idOfLead.equals(null) instead of idOfLead == null.

Vulnerability: CWE-581: Object Model Violation: Just One of Equals and Hashcode Defined
Issue: The code snippet provides an implementation of the hashCode() method without a corresponding equals() method. According to the Java object contract, if two objects are considered equal, they must have the same hash code. Implementing only one of these methods can lead to inconsistent behavior and violate the object contract.
Solution: Implement both the equals() and hashCode() methods consistently. If you override one of them, you should also override the other to maintain the object contract. Ensure that objects that are considered equal have the same hash code.

================================================================================
Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the provided `hashCode` method:

Scenario 1: Verify hashCode for non-null idOfLead

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeForNonNullIdOfLead
  Description: This test verifies that the hashCode method generates the correct hash code when idOfLead is not null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the hashCode method, and set idOfLead to a non-null value.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the generated hash code with the expected hash code calculated manually.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly calculates the hash code based on the non-null idOfLead value.
  This test ensures that the hashCode method follows the contract of generating consistent hash codes for non-null idOfLead values.

Scenario 2: Verify hashCode for null idOfLead

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeForNullIdOfLead
  Description: This test verifies that the hashCode method generates the correct hash code when idOfLead is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the hashCode method, and set idOfLead to null.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the generated hash code with the expected hash code calculated manually.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly handles the case when idOfLead is null and generates the appropriate hash code.
  This test ensures that the hashCode method does not throw any exceptions and follows the contract of generating consistent hash codes for null idOfLead values.

Scenario 3: Verify hashCode consistency

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeConsistency
  Description: This test verifies that the hashCode method generates consistent hash codes for the same idOfLead value across multiple invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the hashCode method, and set idOfLead to a specific value.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method multiple times on the same instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the generated hash codes and ensure they are equal.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method generates consistent hash codes for the same idOfLead value.
  This test ensures that the hashCode method follows the contract of generating the same hash code for the same input, which is important for the correct behavior of hash-based data structures and algorithms.

Scenario 4: Verify hashCode for different idOfLead values

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeForDifferentIdOfLead
  Description: This test verifies that the hashCode method generates different hash codes for different idOfLead values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple instances of the class containing the hashCode method, and set idOfLead to different values for each instance.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on each instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the generated hash codes and ensure they are different.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method generates different hash codes for different idOfLead values.
  This test ensures that the hashCode method follows the contract of generating different hash codes for different input values, which helps in avoiding collisions in hash-based data structures and algorithms.

These test scenarios cover the basic functionality and edge cases of the `hashCode` method. They ensure that the method generates correct and consistent hash codes for different scenarios, including non-null and null `idOfLead` values, and verifies the consistency and uniqueness of the generated hash codes.
