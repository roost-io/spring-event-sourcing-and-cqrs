ROOST_METHOD_HASH=hashCode_d902b37446
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_5a2657087a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Format String (CWE-134)
Issue: The hashCode() function uses string formatting. This could potentially be used for an Uncontrolled Format String attack, causing unexpected behavior or crash.
Solution: Replace string formatting with a safer method, or ensure all inputs are properly validated and sanitized before being used.

Vulnerability: Null Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)
Issue: The hashCode() function has potential for a null pointer exception with 'idOfLead'. An attacker could potentially use this to crash the system or expose sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure objects are initialized before use, or include null checks before referencing object properties.

Vulnerability: Insecure Hashing Algorithm (CWE-328)
Issue: hashCode() may not provide a secure hash as it can provide duplicate results for different inputs. This can lead to security vulnerabilities if used for password or data integrity checks.
Solution: Consider using a more secure hashing function, such as SHA-256, which are designed to minimize the possibility of hash collisions.

Vulnerability: Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326)
Issue: The use of hashCode can lead to inadequate encryption strength that can be easily broken.
Solution: Consider a stronger method of encryption for sensitive data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: HashCode for Null idOfLead 
Details:  
  TestName: validateHashCodeForNullIdLead
  Description: This test is meant to check the result of the hashCode method when the idOfLead is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up idOfLead to be null.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the hashCode method is equal to 1 (prime number).
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the hashing algorithm handles null inputs correctly. A null id should simply return the prime number (1 in this case), with no further computation.

Scenario 2: HashCode for Non-Null idOfLead
Details:  
  TestName: validateHashCodeForNonNullIdLead
  Description: This test is meant to check the result of the hashCode method when idOfLead is not null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up idOfLead to a non-null UUID.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is not equal to 1, implying that the idOfLead’s hashCode has been factored into the result.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that non-null ids are factored into the hashCode computation. The significance is that ids, when present, should play a role in defining the object’s hash.

Scenario 3: Consistent HashCodes Across Invocations
Details:  
  TestName: validateConsistentHashCodes
  Description: The test is meant to check that the hashCode method returns the same result across multiple invocations for the same object instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an instance with an idOfLead.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method multiple times on the same object instance.
  Assert: Assert that all results are equal.
Validation: 
  This test verifies the compliance of the hashCode method with the Java hashCode contract. The significance is to ensure hashCode consistency, critical for the correct operation of Java collections such as HashSet and HashMap.

Scenario 4: Different HashCodes for Different idOfLeads
Details:  
  TestName: validateDifferentHashCodesForDifferentIds
  Description: This test is meant to check that different idOfLeads give different hashCodes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two objects with different idOfLeads.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on each object.
  Assert: Assert that the result for each object is different.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the hashCode implementation provides a good distribution for different ids. This is important for the performance of hash-based collections, as good distribution minimizes collisions.
