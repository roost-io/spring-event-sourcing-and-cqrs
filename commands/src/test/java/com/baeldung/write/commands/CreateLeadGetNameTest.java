================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The application might expose sensitive information to an actor that catches error messages.
Solution: Java exception handling should be used to catch any potential errors and the error messages provided to users should be sanitized and generic to not expose sensitive system information.

Vulnerability: CWE-328: Reversible One-Way Hash
Issue: If bad cryptography practices are used, sensitive data can be exposed to attackers.
Solution: To avoid this, use java security libraries and follow the best practices for cryptography. Avoid using deprecated methods and use strong algorithms.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: Java applications that take a URL as an input and redirect to it can be manipulated to redirect a user to an untrusted site.
Solution: To correct this, use a safe list for URLs that your application can redirect and validate URL parameters.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE')
Issue: Java applications that parse XML can be subject to XXE attacks, resulting in disclosure of data, denial of service, SSRF, and more.
Solution: Disable DTDs (Document Type Definitions), or use libraries that are not vulnerable to XXE by design.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Positive Test for getName Method

Details:  
  TestName: testNameShouldReturnCorrectName
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getName method correctly returns the name set in an instance of the class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set a name for it.
  Act: Invoke the getName method.
  Assert: Assert if the returned value from the getName method is equal to the name set.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies whether the correct name is returned by the getName method. This is as expected as the getName method is supposed to return the name set in the class instance. This test is important for verifying the basic functionality of the getName method.

Scenario 2: Null Test for getName Method

Details:
  TestName: testNameShouldReturnNullIfNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getName method returns null when no name was set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting a name.
  Act: Invoke the getName method.
  Assert: Assert if the returned value from the getName method is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies whether null is returned by the getName method when no name is set. This is as expected as when no name is set, the getName method should return null. This test is significant for checking if the getName method can handle cases where no name was set.

Scenario 3: Test for getName Method with Special Characters

Details:
  TestName: testNameShouldReturnNameWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: The test is meant to check if the getName method accurately returns a name with special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set a name with special characters for it.
  Act: Invoke the getName method.
  Assert: Assert if the returned value from the getName method is equal to the name with special characters set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies whether the get method returns a name with special characters correctly. This is as expected because the method should handle any string, including those with special characters. This test is important to confirm if the method handles names with special characters correctly.

Scenario 4: Test for getName Method with Numeric Input

Details:
  TestName: testNameShouldReturnNumericName
  Description: To check if the getName method accurately returns a name that contains numeric characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set a name that contains numeric characters for it.
  Act: Invoke the getName method.
  Assert: Assert if the returned value from the getName method is equal to the name that contains numeric characters set.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies whether the getName method returns a name that contains numeric characters correctly. This is as expected because the method should handle any string, including those with numeric characters. This test is important to confirm if the method handles names with numeric characters correctly.
