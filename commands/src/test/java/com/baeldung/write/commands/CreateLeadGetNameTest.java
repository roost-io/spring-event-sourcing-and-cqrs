================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: If the getName() method is accessible publicly, it can expose sensitive data or even allow unauthorized manipulation of objects.
Solution: Limit accessibility of methods to only what's necessary. Implement authorization checks for accessing/manipulating objects.

Vulnerability: Unvalidated Input
Issue: Although not evident from the given code, Java applications are often vulnerable to attacks caused by unvalidated or improperly validated input. This can lead to injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), among others.
Solution: Make sure all input is validated using an allowlist approach. Be wary of methods that interpret the input as code/command like Runtime.exec.

Vulnerability: Improper Error Handling
Issue: Exceptions and errors should be properly handled in any Java application. If not, it may lead to information leakage, DOS attacks, or unexpected behavior.
Solution: Implement appropriate error handling in your Java application. Do not expose sensitive information in error messages.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Retrieval of the Name from the getName Method

Details:  
  TestName: testGetNameSuccessfully.
  Description: The test will check if the method is able to retrieve the correct name when it's not null and not empty. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a non-empty value for the name.
  Act: Call the getName() method.
  Assert: Expect the returned name from getName() method to be equal to the set name.
Validation: 
  The successful retrieval of the name ensures that the method is performing its intended functionality correctly. This is important for this method since it is basic for object identification.

Scenario 2: Check If getName can Handle NULL Value

Details:  
  TestName: testGetNameWithNullValue.
  Description: The scenario will test if the getName() function can handle a NULL name correctly without throwing any exceptions. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a NULL value for the name.
  Act: Call the getName() method.
  Assert: Expect the returned name from getName() method to be equal to NULL.
Validation: 
  The test is important to ensure getName() method can handle NULL values without throwing exceptions. It is important because it ensures stability of the application even with unexpected input.

Scenario 3: Check If getName can Handle Empty String Value

Details:  
  TestName: testGetNameWithEmptyStringValue.
  Description: This case will verify if the getName() function can handle an empty string correctly without throwing any exceptions. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty string value for the name.
  Act: Call the getName() method.
  Assert: Expect the returned name from getName() method to be equal to the empty string.
Validation: 
  The test ensures that if the name is an empty string, then the getName() function can handle it correctly and return the empty string. It's important to assure that the application handles empty strings effectively and efficiently.
