 *
 * Scenario 1: Test GetName Method With Assigned Name
 *
 * Details: TestName: testGetNameWithAssignedName Description: This test is designed to
 * check the method's ability to retrieve the correct name after it has been assigned.
 * Execution: Arrange: Assign a name to the 'name' variable. Act: Invoke getName method.
 * Assert: Check if the returned name is same as the assigned name. Validation: The
 * assertion verifies that the getName method retrieves the correctly assigned value. This
 * is important to ensure accurate retrieval of assigned data.
 *
 * Scenario 2: Check GetName Method With Null Name
 *
 * Details: TestName: testGetNameWithNullName Description: This test is targeted to check
 * how the method behaves when the 'name' variable is null. Execution: Arrange: Do not
 * assign anything to 'name', leaving it null. Act: Invoke getName method. Assert: Check
 * if the returned value is null. Validation: This assertion results in checking whether
 * the getName() returns null, given that name variable is set to null. It is important to
 * know how the method behaves when name contains no data.
 *
 * Scenario 3: Test getName Method With Empty String
 *
 * Details: TestName: testGetNameWithEmptyString Description: This test is aimed at
 * checking whether getName() returns an empty string ('') when the 'name' variable is set
 * to an empty string. Execution: Arrange: Assign an empty string to 'name' variable. Act:
 * Invoke getName method. Assert: Check if the returned value is an empty string.
 * Validation: The assertion confirms that the getName returns an empty string when the
 * 'name' is set to an empty string. It helps us ensure that the getName function doesn't
 * modify the input data in any way.
 *
 * Scenario 4: Test getName Method With Random String
 *
 * Details: TestName: testGetNameWithRandomString Description: This test is conducted to
 * assure that the getName function retrieves a correct string, even if it's random or
 * nonsensical. Execution: Arrange: Assign a random/nonsensical string to 'name'. Act:
 * Invoke getName method. Assert: Check if the returned value matches the randomly
 * assigned string. Validation: The assertion validates that getName can properly handle
 * and return any kind of string. This is crucial for ensuring the reliability and
 * robustness of the function.
