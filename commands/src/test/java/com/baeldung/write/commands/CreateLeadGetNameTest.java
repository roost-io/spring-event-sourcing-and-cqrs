================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Improper input validation can lead to various types of vulnerabilities including cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, etc.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize the input data to prevent such vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: System data or debugging information might help malicious user to understand the system and can lead to breach.
Solution: Remove the system data or debugging information from error messages and exceptions. Use custom exceptions to convey meaningful message.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for GetName returning the correct name
Details:
  TestName: testGetNameReturnsCorrectString
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the getName() method accurately returns the name assigned to the object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object with a specific name.
  Act: Invoke the getName method.
  Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to compare the returned name against the expected value.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getName method is working correctly, as it should return the name assigned to the object. This is crucial for fetching object data in the application.

Scenario 2: Test for GetName Returning Null
Details:
  TestName: testGetNameReturnsNull
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getName() method when the object has not been associated with a name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object without assigning a name to it.
  Act: Call the getName method.
  Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to check that the name returned is null.
Validation:
  The objective of this test is to validate the cases where the object might not have a name assigned. In such cases, getName method should return null. This is important to handle null cases in the application.

Scenario 3: Test for GetName with special characters
Details:
  TestName: testGetNameWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test verifies the getName() behaviour when the name includes special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object with a name that includes special characters.
  Act: Invoke the getName method.
  Assert: use a JUnit assertion to compare the returned name against the expected value.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getName method correctly handles names containing special characters. This indicates that the method can handle a wide range of valid data inputs.

Scenario 4: Test for GetName with long string names
Details:
  TestName: testGetNameWithLongStrings
  Description: This test checks the getName() method's behaviour when the name is significantly long.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object with a long name string.
  Act: Invoke the getName method.
  Assert: use a JUnit assertion to compare the returned name against the expected value.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the handling of long strings by the getName method. This is important to ensure the method can handle atypical but valid data inputs.

Note: As getName is a simple getter method, the range of potential test cases is somewhat limited. However, these scenarios cover the most likely behaviours.
