Scenario 1: Testing for Object Equality

  Details:  
    TestName: testForEquality
    Description: This test validates the equals method when the method is checking the equality of two similar objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two identical LeadClickOnPromotionalLink objects.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on one of the objects, passing the other as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert True.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies two identical objects as equal.
    This is essential for preserving data integrity and eliminating redundancies in our application.

Scenario 2: Testing for Null Object Equality

  Details:  
    TestName: testForNullEquality
    Description: This test verifies the equals method when the object compared is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a LeadClickOnPromotionalLink object and a null object.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on the created object and compare it with null.
    Assert: Assert False.
  Validation: 
    This test confirms that the equals method correctly identifies a null object is not equal to a non-null one, ensuring that NullPointerExceptions are avoided.
    
Scenario 3: Testing for Different Class Equality

  Details:  
    TestName: testForDifferentClassEquality
    Description: This test ensures the equals method can differentiate instances of different classes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a LeadClickOnPromotionalLink object and an object of a different class.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on the LeadClickOnPromotionalLink object, passing the object of a different class as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert False.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly distinguishes between objects of different classes.
    This prevents incorrect identification of non-identical objects as equal, contributing to the overall accuracy of the application.

Scenario 4: Testing for Different Objects of Same Class

  Details:  
    TestName: testForDifferentObjectsOfSameClass
    Description: To validate the equals method when objects of the same class but different instance variables are compared.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two LeadClickOnPromotionalLink objects with different idOfLead.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on one of the objects, passing the other object with a different id.
    Assert: Assert False.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly differentiates between two objects of the same class with different idOfLead, ensuring the application accurately identifies distinct instances.
