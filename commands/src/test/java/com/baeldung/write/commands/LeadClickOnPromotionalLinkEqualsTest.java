Scenario 1: Identical Object Comparison

Details:
    TestName: testIfObjectsAreIdentityEqual
    Description: The test is meant to verify if the equals method returns true when the compared object is, in fact, the same object.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Set up an object and compare it against itself.
      Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the object as a parameter.
      Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned value is true.
    Validation:
      The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies that the objects are equal because they are one and the same. This is critical as it ensures the implementations of object equality works as expected.

Scenario 2: Null Object comparison

Details:
    TestName: testNullObjectComparison
    Description: The test is meant to verify if the equals method can safely handle null comparisons and return false.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Set up an object and compare it against null.
      Act: Invoke the equals method, passing null as a parameter.
      Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned value is false.
    Validation:
      The assertion checks that no NullPointerException is thrown but instead a false value is returned when null is compared. This is important for overall application stability and error handling.

Scenario 3: Different Class Objects Comparison

Details:
    TestName: testDifferentClassObjectsComparison
    Description: This test is to verify whether equals method returns false when objects from different classes are compared.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Set up an object of the class and another object from a different class.
      Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the second object as a parameter.
      Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned value is false.
    Validation:
      The assertion verifies that objects from different classes are not considered equal, which is essential for accurate object equality determination in Java.

Scenario 4: Different ID Comparison

Details:
    TestName: testComparingObjectsWithDifferentIdOfLead
    Description: The test is set to verify if the equals method returns false when the objects are of the same class but the "idOfLead" attribute is different.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Set up two objects of the same class, but with different "idOfLead" attributes.
      Act: Invoke the equals method, passing one object as a parameter to the other.
      Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned value is false.
    Validation:
      The assertion confirms that the method correctly identifies that objects are not equal when their "idOfLead" attributes differ. This is essential for ensuring accurate business logic, especially in scenarios where "idOfLead" is a critical business attribute.
