================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-398: Code Quality
Issue: The code does not check or handle a case where 'idOfLead' could be null. The object comparison operation can throw a NullPointerException.
Solution: You should add a null-check before invoking methods on 'idOfLead'. Alternatively, use Objects.equals() to prevent NullPointerException.

Vulnerability: CWE-486: Comparable Interface Misuse
Issue: In order to make your method more flexible and work correctly with collections, the equals() method should ideally test for instanceof and not test for getClass() equivalence. This allows the method to accept subclasses.
Solution: Replace the getClass() comparison with an 'instanceof' check. Note that this check is only applicable if you allow inheritance for the class.

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: Without an explicit type conversion or check, this code could potentially open up for bugs and vulnerabilities if the values are not of the type expected. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Ensure to include type checks, or preferably limit to one type of value to be safe.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Testing equals() method when both objects are identical
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualsWithIdenticalObjects
    Description: This test will check if the equals() method returns true when comparing an object to itself. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink.
    Act: Invoke equals() method by passing this instance as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the equals() method returns true. 
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that an object is equal to itself. If it fails, the equals method is probably incorrectly implemented. 

  Scenario 2: Testing equals() method when the object passed is null

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualsWithNull
    Description: This test will check if the equals() method returns false when a null object is passed as parameter. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink.
    Act: Invoke equals() method by passing null as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the equals() method returns false. 
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that a null object is not equal to the instantiated object. This is a basic null check and must pass.

  Scenario 3: Testing equals() method when the object passed is of a different type

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentTypeObjects
    Description: This test will check if the equals() method returns false when the class type of the passed object is different from the class type of the object invoking the equals() method. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink and another instance of a different class type.
    Act: Invoke equals() method by passing the different class type object as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the equals() method returns false. 
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that an object of a different class type is not regarded as equal. This is a type-check and must pass.

  Scenario 4: Testing equals() method when the object passed is of the same type but with null id

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualsWithSameTypeNullIdObjects
    Description: This test will check if the equals() method returns false when the object passed has the same class type but has a null idOfLead value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink with idOfLead defined. Create another instance of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink with null idOfLead.
    Act: Invoke equals() method by passing the null id object as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the equals() method returns false. 
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that an object with null idOfLead cannot be equal to an object with a defined idOfLead.

  Scenario 5: Testing equals() method when the object passed is of the same type but with different id

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualsWithSameTypeDifferentIdObjects
    Description: This test will check if the equals() method returns false when the object passed has the same class type but different idOfLead value than the object invoking the equals() method. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two instances of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink with different idOfLead values.
    Act: Invoke equals() method by passing one of the objects as the parameter to the equals method of the other object.
    Assert: Assert that the equals() method returns false. 
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that two objects of same class type but with different idOfLead values are not considered equal.
