================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled object reference CWE-706
Issue: The code directly exposes an internal representation of an object. How the object is accessed can be exploited by an attacker to get unauthorized access to data or resources. In this case, it can lead to unauthorized access or modification of leads data.
Solution: It's recommended to not expose the internal representation of any object. If it's unavoidable to expose it, make sure to use a copy of it. Alternatively, a wrapper or accessor can be used, which restricts the range of possible inputs.

Vulnerability: Class casting
Issue: The ClassCastException could be thrown if the object is not of the type you're trying to cast it to. Unhandled exceptions could lead to application crash or unexpected behavior that could be exploited by an attacker.
Solution: Before casting an object, check if it can be converted to the desired type using instanceof keyword. Also, providing relevant exceptions handling mechanism would prevent unhandled exceptions in application.

Vulnerability: Null-Pointer dereferencing CWE-476
Issue: The code doesn't seem to handle null pointers, which could lead to a null pointer exception if the variable idOfLead is null. Null pointer exceptions may cause program to crash, leading to Denial of Service, and disrupt regular program execution.
Solution: It's recommended to always do a null-check before accessing the object or include a try-catch block to catch Null Pointer Exception.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Test Equality when same Object is compared with itself
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualityOfSameObject
    Description: The test will check if an object is equal to itself.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An instance of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink will be created.
    Act: The object instance will be compared to itself using equals() method.
    Assert: Assert that the method returns true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion is meant to verify the reflexivity property of the equals() method, where an object should be equal to itself. This test verifies that the method follows the contract defined for equals() in Java.

  Scenario 2: Test Equality when two different Objects of the same Class are compared
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualityOfDifferentSameClassObjects
    Description: The test is intended to compare two different instances of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink with identical idOfLead.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Two instances of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink with the same idOfLead will be created.
    Act: Invoke the equals() method to compare these two objects.
    Assert: Assert that equals() method returns true.
  Validation: 
    As the two instances of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink class have the same idOfLead, equals() should return true. This test verifies that the method behaves as expected when comparing objects of the same class with identical states.

  Scenario 3: Test Equality when instances of different Classes are compared

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualityOfInstancesFromDifferentClasses
    Description: The test will compare an instance of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink with an instance of a different class.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink and an instance of another class.
    Act: Invoke the equals() method to compare these two objects.
    Assert: Assert that equals() method returns false.
  Validation: 
    As equals() should return false when comparing objects of different classes, this validation confirms the method follows the contract defined for equals() in Java.

  Scenario 4: Test Equality with Null

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualityWithNull
    Description: The test is meant to compare an instance of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink with null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink.
    Act: Invoke the equals() method to compare the instance with null.
    Assert: Assert that equals() returns false.
  Validation: 
    Since equals() should return false when comparing any object with null, this validation confirms the method follows the contract defined for equals() in Java.

  Scenario 5: Test Equality when idOfLead is Null

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualityWhenidOfLeadisNull
    Description: The test is intended to compare two instances of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink, one with a null idOfLead, and another with a non-null idOfLead.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two instances of LeadClickOnPromotionalLink, one with a null idOfLead and the other with a non-null idOfLead.
    Act: Invoke equals() to compare these two objects.
    Assert: Assert that the equals() method returns false.
  Validation: 
    When comparing two instances, one with a null idOfLead and the other with a non-null idOfLead, equals() should return false. This test ensures the method handles null idOfLead appropriately.
