 *
 * """ Scenario 1: Test when both objects are identical
 *
 * Details: TestName: testBothObjectsIdentical Description: This test is meant to check if
 * the equals method correctly identifies when 'this' and 'obj' are the exact same object.
 * Execution: Arrange: Set 'obj' to be the same object as 'this'. Act: Invoke the equals
 * method with obj as the parameter. Assert: Expected result is True. Validation:
 * Assertion verifies that the equals method identifies when both objects are exactly the
 * same. This test case is crucial because it's a basic confirmation of the equivalence
 * relation.
 *
 *
 * Scenario 2: Test when obj is null
 *
 * Details: TestName: testObjectIsNull Description: This test is meant to check if the
 * equals method correctly identifies when 'obj' is null. Execution: Arrange: Set 'obj' to
 * null. Act: Invoke the equals method with obj as the parameter. Assert: Expected result
 * is False. Validation: Assertion verifies that the equals method recognizes a null
 * object as not equal to any other object including itself. This test is important as it
 * ensures fail-safe behavior of equals method.
 *
 *
 * Scenario 3: Test when objects are of different classes
 *
 * Details: TestName: testObjectsOfDifferentClass Description: This test is to check if
 * the equals method correctly identifies when 'this' and 'obj' are of different classes.
 * Execution: Arrange: Instantiate 'obj' as an instance of a class different from the
 * class of 'this'. Act: Invoke the equals method with obj as the parameter. Assert:
 * Expected result is False. Validation: Assertion verifies that the equals method
 * identifies when the two objects are of different classes. This test is crucial as one
 * of the properties of the equals() contract is that it should not find objects of
 * different classes equal.
 *
 *
 * Scenario 4: Testing when idOfLead in both objects are null
 *
 * Details: TestName: testIdOfLeadInBothObjectsIsNull Description: This test is to check
 * if the equals method correctly identifies when idOfLead in both 'this' and 'obj' are
 * null. Execution: Arrange: Set the idOfLead in both 'this' and 'obj' to null. Act:
 * Invoke the equals method with obj as the parameter. Assert: Expected result is True.
 * Validation: Assertion verifies that the equals method identifies when idOfLead in both
 * objects are null. This test is important as it tests the behavior of the method when
 * dealing with null values in the object fields.
 *
 *
 * Scenario 5: Testing when idOfLead in 'this' is null but not in 'obj'
 *
 * Details: TestName: testIdOfLeadNullInThisButNotNullInObj Description: This test is to
 * check if the equals method correctly identifies when idOfLead in 'this' is null but not
 * in 'obj'. Execution: Arrange: Set the idOfLead in 'this' to null and in 'obj' to a
 * non-null value. Act: Invoke the equals method with obj as the parameter. Assert:
 * Expected result is False. Validation: Assertion verifies that the equals method
 * identifies when idOfLead in 'this' is null but not in 'obj'. This test is important as
 * it checks the behavior of the method when dealing with null values in one object but
 * non-null value in the other.
 *
 *
 * Scenario 6: Testing when idOfLead in both objects are not null but different
 *
 * Details: TestName: testIdOfLeadInBothObjectsNotNullButDifferent Description: This test
 * is to check if the equals method correctly identifies when idOfLead in both 'this' and
 * 'obj' are not null but different. Execution: Arrange: Set the idOfLead in both 'this'
 * and 'obj' to non-null different values. Act: Invoke the equals method with obj as the
 * parameter. Assert: Expected result is False. Validation: Assertion verifies that the
 * equals method identifies when idOfLead in both objects are not null but different. This
 * test is crucial as it tests the equality check of equals method when fields are not
 * null. """
