================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated User Input (CWE-20)
Issue: The setName function directly assigns user input to the instance variable. This may expose the application to Injection attacks or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the input is used in the context of a web application.
Solution: The user input should be validated or sanitized before assignment. A possible approach would be applying a whitelist of allowed characters or using a function that escapes harmful input.

Vulnerability: Missing Access Modifier (CWE-732)
Issue: The method setName does not have an access modifier (public, protected, private) and therefore, defaults to package-private. This can lead to unauthorized access if the security enforcement model is improperly set up or lacking.
Solution: Specify an appropriate access modifier for the method, based on the principle of least privilege.

Vulnerability: Missing Input Length Checks (CWE-676)
Issue: Assigning user input to the instance variable without checking its length could cause Denial Of Service (DOS) by facilitating Out Of Memory (OOM) errors.
Solution: Implement checks to validate the length of user input before assignment.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate setName Method with Proper Input.
  
  Details:  
    TestName: validateSetNameMethodWithProperInput.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setName method is working as expected when provided with a proper string input. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a string variable with a valid value. 
    Act: Invoke the setName method with the initialized string. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the name field in the object is set as per the input string.
  Validation: 
    This assertion validates if the method setName is setting the name properly.
    It's critical for ensuring that the method can set the name attribute as specified by the user.
    
Scenario 2: Validate setName Method with Null Input.
  
  Details:  
    TestName: validateSetNameMethodWithNullInput.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setName method can handle a null input and does not throw any exceptions or errors. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a String variable with a null value.
    Act: Invoke the setName method with the initialized null string. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the name field in the object is set to null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion ensures that the setName method can handle null inputs without throwing any exceptions.
    It's crucial for handling cases where the user does not specify a name attribute.

Scenario 3: Validate setName Method with Empty String.

  Details:
    TestName: validateSetNameMethodWithEmptyString.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setName method can handle an empty string input and sets the name field to an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a String variable with an empty string value.
    Act: Invoke the setName method with the initialized empty string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the name field in the object is set to an empty string.
  Validation:
    This test validates that the setName method can appropriately handle an empty string input.
    It's important in order to confirm that the users can't set the empty string as a name.

Scenario 4: Validate setName Method with Special Characters.

  Details:
    TestName: validateSetNameMethodWithSpecialCharacters.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setName method can handle a string with special characters and sets the name field appropriately.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a String variable with a string that includes special characters.
    Act: Invoke the setName method with the initialized string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the name field in the object is the same as the input string.
  Validation:
    This assertion ensures that the setName method can handle strings with special characters.
    It's crucial to validate that users can set a name that includes special characters.
