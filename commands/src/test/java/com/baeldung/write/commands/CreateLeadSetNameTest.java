================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The setName method sets the name without performing any form of validation. This could potentially lead to issues like code injection, if not handled properly at another level.
Solution: Validate input before usage. Consider using standard input validation libraries or built-in features to ensure the provided name meets your application's requirements and does not contain any harmful characters or sequences.

Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
Issue: If this name is intended to be secret (like a password), storing it in this manner could allow attackers easier guessing or brute force attacks.
Solution: If the 'name' is actually a secret like a password, consider storing a hashed and salted version of the password instead of the plaintext form.

"""
Scenario 1: Test Set Name
Details:  
  TestName: testNameSetterHappyPath
  Description: This test serves to check the setName method's ability to assign a value to the name variable. The test implies the standard operation of setName with valid input data.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a class and prepare a String variable containing a valid name.
    Act: Invoke setName method with the valid name.
    Assert: Check if the name variable has been successfully set with the given name.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that setName method functions as expected under normal operating circumstances. It is crucial in making sure the method adheres to its documentation and provides the expected functionality.

Scenario 2: Set Name To Null
Details:  
  TestName: testNameSetterWithNull
  Description: This test aims to assess the behavior of setName when provided with a null value, it's an edge-case scenario.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a class.
    Act: Invoke setName method with a null value.
    Assert: Check if the name variable is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the setName method correctly assigns null to the name variable when provided with a null value. This is crucial to ensure that the code handles null input gracefully and doesn't throw an unexpected exception.

Scenario 3: Set Name to Empty String
Details:  
  TestName: testNameSetterWithEmptyString
  Description: This test serves to examine how setName behaves when given an empty string. This is another edge-case scenario.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a class.
    Act: Invoke setName method with an empty string.
    Assert: Check if the name variable is an empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion validates that setName can handle an empty string, setting the name variable to an empty value. This ensures the method can handle edge-case scenario appropriately.
