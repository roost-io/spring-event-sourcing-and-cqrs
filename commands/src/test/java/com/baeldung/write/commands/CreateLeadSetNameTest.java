Scenario 1: Test to verify the functionality of 'setName' when given a valid string

  Details:
    TestName: testSetNameWithValidString
    Description: This test is designed to check the 'setName' method when given a valid string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string that will be used to set the name.
    Act: Invoke the target method with the arranged string.
    Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to check if the name of the object matches the string used to set it.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the 'setName' method properly sets the name of the object. This is a crucial functionality for maintaining accurate object identification.

Scenario 2: Test to validate the 'setName' method when given an empty string

  Details:
    TestName: testSetNameWithEmptyString
    Description: This test is designed to validate the 'setName' method when given an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the target method with the empty string.
    Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to check if the name of the object matches the empty string.
  Validation:
    This assertion checks whether the 'setName' method properly sets the name of the object even if an empty string is provided. This covers the edge case where an object may be nameless.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the 'setName' method when a null value is passed

  Details:
    TestName: testSetNameWithNullValue
    Description: This test is intended to check the 'setName' method when a null value is passed. This checks the failure mechanism of the function for null inputs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement necessary as a null value does not need to be created.
    Act: Invoke the target method with null as a parameter.
    Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to check if an Exception was thrown.
  Validation:
    This assertion is meant to verify that the 'setName' method throws an Exception when given null as a parameter. This is an important test as it validates the method's error handling mechanisms.
