================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Inefficient Object Type Check (CWE-597)
Issue: Using getClass() to check for object type can create issues if subclasses are expected to be equal to their superclass instance. Calling getClass() breaks the general contract of equals(Object) which is designed to allow for subtype equality.
Solution: Use 'instanceof' for object type check in the equals method for allowing correct behavior with subclasses.

Vulnerability: Redundant Null Check (CWE-571)
Issue: There's a redundant null check on 'name'. If 'name' is null and it is equal to the other 'name' object that is also null, the function will return false, which is incorrect.
Solution: Remove redundant null checks. Consider using Java's Objects.equals() method which safely checks for equality even when arguments are null.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the equal method with the same object
  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualsWithSameObject
    Description: We test the equal method with the same object and expect the result to be true. This satisfies the reflexive property of the equals method, which states that for a non-null reference, this method should return true.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a single CreateLead object. 
    Act: Invoke the equals method, with this object as an input.
    Assert: Assert that the response is true.
  Validation:
    The equals method should return true if we compare the same object. It is significant as it validates the reflexive property, essential for Java's equal method.

Scenario 2: Testing the equal method with a null object
  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject
    Description: We test the equal method with a null object. The method should return false since an object is never equals to null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new CreateLead object. 
    Act: Invoke the equals method on this object, passing null as an argument.
    Assert: Assert that the response is false.
  Validation:
    The equals method should return false if we compare it with a null. This is an essential condition in Java to test equality.

Scenario 3: Testing the equal method with different types of Objects
  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentObjectType
    Description: We test the equal method with a different type of object. The method should return false as the objects are of different types.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new CreateLead object and a different type of object. 
    Act: Invoke the equals method with the different type of object as an argument.
    Assert: Assert that the response is false.
  Validation:
    We are validating that the equals method only return true if the two object types are the same. 

Scenario 4: Testing the equal method with objects having different properties
  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentProperties
    Description: We test the equals method with two objects of same type but different properties. The method should return false as objects are not equal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two CreateLead objects with different 'name' properties. 
    Act: Invoke the equals() method, comparing these two objects.
    Assert: Assert that the response is false.
  Validation:
    We are checking if the equals method correctly identifies when two objects of the same type are not equal due to different properties. 

Scenario 5: Testing the equals method with objects having same properties
  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualsWithSameProperties
    Description: We test the equal method with two objects of same type and identical properties. The method should return true as both objects are equal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two CreateLead objects with the same 'name' properties.
    Act: Invoke the equals() method, comparing these two objects.
    Assert: Assert that the response is true.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the equals method correctly identifies when two objects of the same type are equal due to identical properties. This is crucial for correctly identifying object equality within the application.
