================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-599: Missing Validation of OpenSSL Certificate
Issue: The code does not perform any validation of SSL/TLS certificates when establishing a secure connection. This can allow for man-in-the-middle attacks if a malicious certificate is presented by an attacker.
Solution: Use a trusted certificate authority and implement proper certificate validation using the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE). Verify the certificate chain, hostname, and expiration date before establishing a secure connection.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The equals() method performs a direct dereference of the 'name' field without checking for null. If 'name' is null, this will throw a NullPointerException which could potentially crash the application or lead to denial of service.
Solution: Add a null check for the 'name' field before dereferencing it. Return false if 'name' is null to properly handle the case when comparing against a null object.

Vulnerability: CWE-581: Object Model Violation: Just One of Equals and Hashcode Defined
Issue: The code overrides the equals() method without also overriding hashCode(). The equals() and hashCode() methods should always be overridden in pairs to maintain the general contract of the Object class and ensure proper behavior when objects are used in hash-based collections.
Solution: Override the hashCode() method in addition to equals(). The hashCode() implementation should return the same hash code value for objects that are considered equal according to the equals() method. This ensures consistent behavior when objects are used in hash-based collections like HashMap or HashSet.

================================================================================
Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the provided `equals` method:

Scenario 1: Comparing object with itself

Details:
  TestName: equalsComparingObjectWithItself
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns true when comparing an object with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreateLead class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the same instance as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that the object is being compared with itself.
  This test ensures that the equals method adheres to the reflexive property of equality.

Scenario 2: Comparing object with null

Details:
  TestName: equalsComparingObjectWithNull
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing an object with null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreateLead class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing null as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles the case when the compared object is null.
  This test ensures that the equals method does not throw a NullPointerException and returns false for null comparisons.

Scenario 3: Comparing object with different class

Details:
  TestName: equalsComparingObjectWithDifferentClass
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing an object with an instance of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the CreateLead class and an instance of a different class (e.g., String).
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the instance of the different class as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that the compared objects are of different classes.
  This test ensures that the equals method adheres to the symmetric property of equality and returns false for objects of different types.

Scenario 4: Comparing objects with same name

Details:
  TestName: equalsComparingObjectsWithSameName
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns true when comparing two CreateLead objects with the same name value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the CreateLead class with the same name value.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing one instance as the parameter to compare with the other.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly compares the name field of the CreateLead objects.
  This test ensures that the equals method considers two CreateLead objects equal if their name values are the same.

Scenario 5: Comparing objects with different names

Details:
  TestName: equalsComparingObjectsWithDifferentNames
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing two CreateLead objects with different name values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the CreateLead class with different name values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing one instance as the parameter to compare with the other.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that the CreateLead objects are not equal when their name values differ.
  This test ensures that the equals method considers two CreateLead objects unequal if their name values are different.

Scenario 6: Comparing objects with null and non-null names

Details:
  TestName: equalsComparingObjectsWithNullAndNonNullNames
  Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing two CreateLead objects, one with a null name and the other with a non-null name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the CreateLead class, one with a null name and the other with a non-null name.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing one instance as the parameter to compare with the other.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly handles the case when one object has a null name and the other has a non-null name.
  This test ensures that the equals method considers two CreateLead objects unequal if one has a null name and the other has a non-null name.

These test scenarios cover various cases and edge conditions for the `equals` method, including comparing an object with itself, null, different classes, and objects with different name values. They ensure that the method adheres to the basic principles of equality and handles null values appropriately.
