"""
Scenario 1: Testing "equals()" method against the same object reference
TestName: testEqualityWithSelf
Description: This test checks the "equals()" method when this == obj scenario. It tests the situation when the exact same object reference is passed, it should return true.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of CreateLead class.
    Act: Invoke "equals()" method passing the same instance.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is true.
Validation:
    The test validates if the "equals()" method correctly identifies the same object references. As per the equality rule, an object should be equal to itself, so the expected result is true.

Scenario 2: Testing "equals()" method against null object
TestName: testEqualityWithNull
Description: This test checks the "equals()" method where obj==null scenario. The method should return false when passed a null object.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of CreateLead class.
    Act: Invoke "equals()" method passing null.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is false.
Validation:
    The validation checks if the "equals()" method correctly identifies null objects as not equal. As per the equality rule, an object should not be equal to null, therefore the expected result is false.

Scenario 3: Testing "equals()" method for objects of different classes
TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentClasses
Description: The test checks the "equals()" method where the obj is an instance from different class. For two objects to be equal, they should belong to the same class.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of CreateLead class and an instance from a different class.
    Act: Invoke "equals()" method passing the object from the different class.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is false.
Validation:
    The validation confirms if the "equals()" method correctly differentiates objects from different classes. It should return false when the objects are from different classes, hence the expected result is false.

Scenario 4: Testing "equals()" method for objects with same class but different name fields
TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentNames
Description: This test checks the "equals()" method when two CreateLead objects with different ‘name’ fields are compared. Objects should be different if their name field is different.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create two instances of CreateLead class with the same class but different 'name'.
    Act: Invoke "equals()" method comparing both objects.
    Assert: Check if the returned result is false.
Validation:
    The assertion verifies if the "equals()" method differentiates instances on the basis of their field values. If the 'name' field is different, then it should return false hence the expected result is false.

Scenario 5: Testing "equals()" method for objects with the same class and identical name fields
TestName: testEqualityWithSameNames
Description: This test checks the "equals()" method when two CreateLead objects have identical 'name' fields. It will test if the method treats these instances as equal.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create two instances of CreateLead class with similar class and 'name'.
    Act: Invoke "equals()" method comparing both objects.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is true.
Validation:
    The validation verifies if the "equals()" method treats instances with identical 'name' fields as equal. Hence the expected result is true.
