/*
The tests failed to execute due to a Maven build failure, not due to any issue with the test cases themselves. The failure occurred while trying to resolve dependencies for the project. Specifically, Maven failed to collect dependencies at com.baeldung:spring-leads-infra:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT. The error also mentioned a failure to read an artifact descriptor for the same dependency.

To resolve this issue, assure the necessary dependencies in the Maven configuration are available. This might involve checking the POM file for correct information regarding the failed dependency, checking the settings.xml file for correct repository settings, or clearing and repopulating the local .m2 repository.

Confirm the availability of 'com.baeldung:spring-leads-infra:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT' in your repository. Also check the networking configurations, as sometimes, firewalls, VPNs, or the use of a non-standard repository can cause issues with retrieving dependencies.
