================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-597: Use of Wrong Operator in String Comparison
Issue: Although this is not a security vulnerability per se, the usage of '==' operator can lead to a logical error in the program. It checks object's equality rather than string's content.
Solution: Replace '==' with '.equals()' when trying to compare the contents of strings.

Vulnerability: Potential sideways reading issue
Issue: Due to the lack of access modifiers on your equals method, this method could be accessed and potentially exploited for information leakage.
Solution: Consider limiting the visibility of your equals method if it doesn't necessary to be public.

Vulnerability: CWE-480: Incorrect use of Null Checking functionality
Issue: The improper use of null checks can result in unexpected behaviour and could potentially cause a Null Pointer Exception.
Solution: Use Java 8's Objects.equals() to simplify null-safe comparison. This helper method is null-safe and hence we don't need to perform any null checks.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check equality with identical reference

  Details:  
    TestName: testIfSameReferenceIsIdentical.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies that two references pointing to the same object are indeed identical.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a CreateLead instance and make another reference to that same instance.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing in the reference to the same object. 
    Assert: Assert that the result is true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the equals method can identify when two references are pointing to the same object. This is important because it's part of the contract of the equals method that an object must be equal to itself.

  Scenario 2: Test to check inequality with null reference

  Details:  
    TestName: testIfNotNull.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies that an object is not equal to null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a CreateLead instance.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing in null.
    Assert: Assert that the result is false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the equals method can identify that an object is not equal to null. This test is important to ensure that the method respects the contract of equals, which specifies that no object should be equal to null.

  Scenario 3: Test to check inequality with different class instance
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testInequalityWithDifferentClassInstance
    Description: This test is meant to check that the equals method correctly identifies that an instance of CreateLead is not equal to an instance of another class.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a CreateLead instance and an instance of another class.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing in the instance of another class.
    Assert: Assert that the result is false.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the equals method can identify that an object is not equal to an instance of a different class. This is an important validation to ensure type safety in the equals method.

  Scenario 4: Test to check inequality with different names
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testInequalityWithDifferentNames
    Description: This test is meant to check that the equals method correctly identifies that two CreateLead instances with different names are not equal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two CreateLead instances with different names.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing in the other CreateLead instance.
    Assert: Assert that the result is false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the equals method can correctly identify when two objects are not equal, by comparing their names. This is important in the application behavior context, as CreateLead instances should not be considered equal if their names do not match.

  Scenario 5: Test to check equality with the same names

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualityWithSameNames
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the equals method correctly identifies that two CreateLead instances with identical names are equal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two CreateLead instances with the same name.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing in the other CreateLead instance.
    Assert: Assert that the result is true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the equals method can correctly identify when two objects of type CreateLead with the same name are equal. This is essential in the context of application behavior, as CreateLead instances should be considered equal if their names match.
