================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)
Issue: In the equals method, it's comparing object's class types using the getClass() method. This potentially leads to a problem known as 'resource exhaustion'. Any large-scale equality check between heterogeneous objects can lead to increased CPU utilization and slowdowns.
Solution: It's usually better to use 'instanceof' for class comparison as it takes into account polymorphism, won't break when a subclass is passed and also avoids risk of resource exhaustion.

Vulnerability: Use of Hazardous Equals (CWE-597)
Issue: The equals() method uses direct comparison of class-specific fields like 'name'. If these fields contain sensitive data, comparison can lead to both performance issues and potential information leakage.
Solution: Consider writing a custom equals() method that doesn't rely on direct field comparison. If field comparison is essential, be sure to handle sensitive fields with due diligence.

Vulnerability: Null Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)
Issue: The equals method checks if 'name' is null and then proceeds to use name.equals(other.name). If 'other.name' is null, this will throw a NullPointerException.
Solution: It's recommended to use Objects.equals(name, other.name) instead of name.equals(other.name) to seamlessly handle null values.

"""
 Scenario 1: Test for identical objects

 Details:  
    TestName: testIdenticalObjects.
    Description: This test checks if the considered objects are identical. In this case, the equals method should return true. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CreateLead object and assign identical value to another. 
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the identical object. 
    Assert: Assert the returned result to be true.
  Validation:
    Explanation of our assertions aim to verify that the equals method correctly identifies identical objects. If the objects are identical, the equals method should return true.

Scenario 2: Test for null objects

Details:  
    TestName: testNullObject.
    Description: This test checks if the object passed to the equals method is null. In this case, the equals method should return false. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CreateLead object. Don't create a second object.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing null.
    Assert: Assert that the returned result is false.
  Validation:
    We aim to verify that the equals method correctly identifies null objects. If the passed object is null, the equals method should return false. 


Scenario 3: Test when comparing objects of different classes

Details:  
    TestName: testObjectsOfDifferentClasses.
    Description: This test checks if two objects belong to different classes. In this case, the equals method should return false. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CreateLead object and an object of a different class. 
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing an object of a different class.
    Assert: Assert the returned result to be false.
  Validation:
    We aim to verify that the equals method correctly identifies objects of different classes. If the objects belong to different classes, the equals method should return false. 


Scenario 4: Test when comparing objects with different names

Details:
    TestName: testObjectsWithDifferentNames.
    Description: This test checks whether two objects have different names. In this case, the equals method should return false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two CreateLead objects with different names.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the second object.
    Assert: Assert the returned result to be false.
  Validation:
    Our assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies objects with different names. If the names are not identical, the equals method should return false. 

Scenario 5: Test when comparing objects with identical names

Details:
    TestName: testObjectsWithIdenticalNames.
    Description: This test checks whether two objects have identical names. In this case, the equals method should return true.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two CreateLead objects with identical names.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the second object.
    Assert: Assert the returned result to be true.
  Validation:
    Our assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies objects with identical names. If the names are identical, the equals method should return true.
