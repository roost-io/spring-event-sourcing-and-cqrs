""" 
  Scenario 1: Test comparison of two identical objects

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualityOfIdenticalObjects.
    Description: This test aims to check if the equals method correctly identifies two identical objects as equal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two identical objects.  
    Act: Compare the two objects using the equals method. 
    Assert: The method should return 'true'.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that identical objects are indeed marked as equal by the equals method. This ensures the correct behavior of the method in such scenarios.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Scenario 2: Test comparison of an object with null

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualityWithNull.
    Description: This test verifies if the equals method correctly identifies a null object as not equal to a non-null object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create one object and one null object. 
    Act: Compare the two using the equals method. 
    Assert: The method should return 'false'.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should produce 'false' when comparing any object with null. This ensures the correctness of the method in handling null objects.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Scenario 3: Test comparison of objects from different classes

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualityOfDifferentClasses.
    Description: Tests if the equals method rightly identifies objects from different classes as not equal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two objects from distinct classes. 
    Act: Compare the two objects using the equals method. 
    Assert: The method should return 'false'.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should confirm that objects from different classes are not equal. This is crucial for preserving object integrity.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Scenario 4: Test comparison of objects with different names

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualityWithDifferentNames.
    Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly distinguishes objects of the same class but with different names as unequal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two objects of the same class but with different names. 
    Act: Compare the two objects using the equals method. 
    Assert: The method should return 'false'.
  Validation: 
    This emphasizes that the equals method should consider the 'name' component when assessing object equality, ensuring correct behavior when comparing objects with different names.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Scenario 5: Test comparison of objects with its own instance

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualityOfSelfInstance.
    Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly recognizes an object is equal to itself.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object.
    Act: Compare the object using the equals method with itself.
    Assert: The method should return 'true'.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return 'true' when an object is compared to itself which satisfies reflexivity of equals method requirement in Java.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Scenario 6: Test comparison of two objects with null names

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualityOfNullNames.
    Description: This test verifies if the equals method correctly identifies two objects with null names as equal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two objects of the same class but with null names.
    Act: Compare the two objects using the equals method. 
    Assert: The method should return 'true'.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should consider the 'name' component when assessing object equality, ensuring correct behavior when comparing objects with null names.
