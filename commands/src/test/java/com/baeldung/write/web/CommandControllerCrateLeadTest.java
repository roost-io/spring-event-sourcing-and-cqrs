================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Incomplete parameter validation (Potential CWE-20)
Issue: In the `createLead` function, although `@Valid` annotation is used, there is no clear indication whether all input fields in `CreateLead` object are thoroughly validated.
Solution: Create corresponding validation annotations in the CreateLead command object to ensure each field is validated upon submission. E.g., @NotNull, @NotEmpty, etc.

Vulnerability: Unvalidated redirects and forwards (CWE-601)
Issue: Although not shown in the given code, using Spring framework without properly validating redirects or forwards can expose the application to URL redirection attacks.
Solution: Ensure you are validating and sanitizing any URL redirects and forwards within your application. Avoid using user input to construct URLs without validating or sanitizing it.

Vulnerability: Potential Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: UUID is used in the `LeadCreated` event, but if it gets exposed to the frontend, it might leak information about your system.
Solution: Ensure you are only returning necessary information to the user and limit exposure of internal identifiers like UUID.

================================================================================
The method "createLead" takes a "createLeadCommand" parameter and uses it to create a "LeadCreated" event, assigning it two random UUID and a name from the command. This event is then saved in the "eventStore". 

Here are the test scenarios: 

Scenario 1: Valid Create Lead  
Details:  
TestName: createLeadWithValidCommand.  
Description: Sending a valid CreateLead command object to the method.   
Execution:  
Arrange: Create a valid CreateLead command object.   
Act: Invoke createLead with the CreateLead command object.  
Assert: No Exception is thrown, the eventStore should have saved the "LeadCreated" event.  
Validation: This test confirms that the createLead method works as expected when given a valid CreateLead command object.

Scenario 2: Null Command  
Details:  
TestName: createLeadWithNullCommand.  
Description: Sending a null command object to the method.   
Execution:  
Arrange: Don't create any command object.  
Act: Invoke createLead with null as the argument.  
Assert: Exception should be thrown as the method annotation @RequestBody assumes the parameter will not be null.   
Validation: This test confirms that the createLead method handles null arguments as expected. Specifically, it throws an exception when given a null command object.

Scenario 3: Invalid CreateLead Command  
Details:  
TestName: createLeadWithInvalidCommand.   
Description: Sending an invalid CreateLead command object to the method where the name field is empty.   
Execution:  
Arrange: Create a CreateLead command object that has an empty name field.  
Act: Invoke createLead with the invalid CreateLead command object.  
Assert: A ConstraintViolationException or similar should be thrown due to the @Valid annotation, asserting the object to be validated.   
Validation: This test confirms that the createLead method correctly validates the CreateLead command object and throws an exception when it is invalid.

Scenario 4: Verify UUIDs  
Details:  
TestName: verifyUUIDsForCreateLead.   
Description: Check whether the UUIDs generated in the method are unique each time createLead is called.   
Execution:  
Arrange: Create two valid CreateLead command objects.  
Act: Invoke createLead twice using the two different command objects.  
Assert: The UUIDs generated in the LeadCreated event for the first call should not be equal to those in the second call.   
Validation: This test confirms that the createLead method generates unique UUIDs for each LeadCreated event.

Scenario 5: Verify Correct Association  
Details:  
TestName: verifyCorrectLeadNameIsAssociated  
Description: Confirm whether the correct name is being associated with the event.   
Execution:  
Arrange: Create a CreateLead command object with a specified name.  
Act: Invoke createLead with the CreateLead command object.  
Assert: The name in the created LeadCreated event should be equal to the name provided in the CreateLead command object.   
Validation: This test confirms that the createLead method associates the correct name with the LeadCreated event.
