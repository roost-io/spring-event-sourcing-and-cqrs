================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The use of random UUID for correlationId may expose sensitive information. If the generated UUID is predictable, it could be possible for attackers to interfere with user sessions.
Solution: Ensure that the UUID generator is cryptographically strong or consider using secure session IDs provided by the framework.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The code does not explicitly define access controls, which could potentially lead to unauthorized data access.
Solution: Use access control mechanisms such as Secured or PreAuthorize annotations for endpoint protection. Ensure proper permissions are set.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: Without proper request validation, your code may be vulnerable to CSRF attacks where an attacker tricks a victim's browser to submit a malicious request to your application.
Solution: Use anti-CSRF measures provided by the framework such as CSRF tokens.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The code seems to be handling data that could be input to SQL queries. If data from the LeadClickOnPromotionalLink object is used in SQL queries without sanitization, it can lead to SQL injection attacks.
Solution: To defend against SQL injection, consider using parameterized queries, ORM libraries, or sanitize inputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: If your application has parts where redirection based on URLs received from a user's request, it could be used for phishing attacks.
Solution: Always validate redirect URLs against a white list of trusted URLs.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Saving of Promotional Link Click Event
TestName: successfulSaveOfPromotionalLinkClickEvent
Description: This test verifies the successful saving of the promotional link click event.
Execution: 
 Arrange: Create a mock of EventStore and @Valid @RequestBody LeadClickOnPromotionalLink object. Setup the EventStore mock such that it successfully saves the event. 
 Act: Invoke the leadClickOnPromotionalLink method with the mock LeadClickOnPromotionalLink object. 
 Assert: Validate with JUnit assertions that the correct event object has been passed to the EventStore for saving.
Validation: This verifies the event is saved successfully. It confirms the business requirement that every valid click on a promotional link should be tracked and stored appropriately.

Scenario 2: Failed Saving of Promotional Link Click Event due to Invalid Data
TestName: failedSaveOfPromotionalLinkDueToInvalidData
Description: This test verifies the handling of errors when the provided link click event data is invalid.
Execution: 
 Arrange: Create a @Valid @RequestBody LeadClickOnPromotionalLink object with invalid data. Setup the EventStore mock to throw validation exceptions. 
 Act: Invoke the leadClickOnPromotionalLink method with the mock LeadClickOnPromotionalLink object. 
 Assert: Catch and Assert exceptions thrown due to invalid data through JUnit assertions.
Validation: This ensures the system is robust and can handle invalid click event data gracefully. It also verifies the application's adherence to the business rule that only valid promotional link clicks should be stored.

Scenario 3: Failed Saving of Promotional Link Click Event due to Backend/error in EventStore
TestName: failedSaveOfPromotionalLinkDueToBackendError
Description: This test verifies the handling of unexpected backend errors during saving of promotional link click event. 
Execution: 
 Arrange: Create a @Valid @RequestBody LeadClickOnPromotionalLink object with valid data. Setup the EventStore mock such that it throws an error on trying to save the event. 
 Act: Invoke the leadClickOnPromotionalLink method with the mock LeadClickOnPromotionalLink object. 
 Assert: Catch and Assert exceptions thrown due to backend error through JUnit assertions.
Validation: This test is essential to ensure the system can handle backend errors gracefully and provide appropriate error messages/logs. It indirectly checks the reliability of the backend component (EventStore).

Scenario 4: Null Object Test
TestName: nullObjectTestForPromotionalLink
Description: This test verifies that the application gracefully handles null provided as input parameter.
Execution:
 Arrange: No arrange step is required as no input data is needed.
 Act: Invoke the leadClickOnPromotionalLink method with null.
 Assert: Catch and assert NullPointerException using JUnit assertions.
Validation: This test ensures the robustness of the code against null inputs. It assures that the code does not break when null input is provided.
