// Pre-requisite: Make sure that all the project dependencies are correctly fetched. In the specific case of 'spring-leads-infra', ensure that the repository
// where 'spring-leads-infra' resides is not blocked and is correctly specified or 'spring-leads-infra' is installed in the local .m2 repository. If the problem persists, 
// try to unblock the repo.spring.io/milestone in the maven settings or check your internet connection.

// Rest of your test cases
